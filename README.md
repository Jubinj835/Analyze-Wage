# Analyze-Wage
Analyze Wage Data with Python:


  In this project, I used pandas and Python to explore and analyze wage data across different industries and occupations. I started by using string methods to clean the dataset and prepare it for analysis.     Then, used pandas calculations to compute annual wages and compare each occupation to its industry average wage. Lastly, used sorting and filtering to understand which occupations are the highest earners.
